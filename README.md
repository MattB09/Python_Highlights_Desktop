# Python_Highlights_Desktop
This was my final project for Harvard's CS50 online course. At the time of building it, I wasn't using version control but I decided to add it to github after I had written all the code. 

This project is for cataloguing and tagging highlights from books you've read.

## Technology

## Installation
Clone the repository. Create a pipenv or virtual environment and install the dependencies with `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
